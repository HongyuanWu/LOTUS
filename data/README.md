# Datasets

As explained in our paper, several datasets are used to compare our algorithm with MutSigCV, TUSON or 20/20+. Additionally, we used datasets from Cancer Census Gene (v86).

These datasets consist in feature matrices, sets of known driver genes, PPI kernels, and in the case of multitask prediction, a similarity matrix.
