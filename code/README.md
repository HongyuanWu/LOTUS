# Code

## Source files

* "lotus.R" contains all codes necessary to run all versions of LOTUS.
* "evaluation.R" contains all codes necessary to compute the consistency error of LOTUS as defined in our paper.

## Example scripts

* "run_lotus.R" and "run_lotus_multitask.R" use the different versions of LOTUS and output some of the results that are displayed in the paper, and can be run again to find the exact same results. They can also be adapted to use additional data, as explained in LOTUS/README.md.

* "evaluate_lotus.R" and "evaluate_lotus_multitask.R" computes the consistency errors for the different versions of LOTUS in "run_lotus.R" and "run_lotus_multitask.R".
